			The BS program prepares students for all potential career positions in the IS field. <br />
			These include: Systems Analysis and Design, Computer Networking and Health Care Informatics. <br />
			<br />
			For successful completion of the degree, all students must satisfy the general education requirements <br /> 
			that are explained in the UMBC Undergraduate Catalog. The required program courses for the <br />
			Bachelor of Science Degree are below. Course descriptions can be found in the Course Catalog. <br />
			<br />
			Effective Fall 2013:  All Information Systems majors must complete at least 9 upper level IS <br />
			and Management courses taught by the IS department at UMBC.

		<h4>Notes</h4>
		<p>
			Students must earn a grade of "C" or better for any course to be applied to the Information Systems major. <br/> <br/>
			Before being allowed to take IS 410 and 450 (and then the rest of the IS 400-level core courses), a student must first complete the following gateway requirements: <br/> <br/>
			A grade of "C" or higher in:
			<ul>
				<li>MATH 155 - Elementary Calculus and</li>
				<li>IS 147 - Introduction to Computer Programming </li>
			</ul>
			And a grade of "B" or higher in:
			<ul>
				<li>IS 300 - Management Information Systems and </li>
				<li>IS 310 - Software and Hardware Concepts </li>
			</ul>
			Students may not repeat IS 300 or 310 more than once. <br/> <br/>
			Students entering UMBC for the first time before Fall 2015 must earn a "B" average with no grade below a "C" in IS 300 and IS 310. <br/> <br/>
			Examples of upper-level electives that could be used to help fulfill the IS major requirements include: IS 303, IS 304, IS 460, IS 461, IS 427, IS 428, IS 430, <br/>
			IS 438, IS 464, IS 471, IS 472, IS 451U, IS 451M, and IS 452, as well as others (see catalog for a full listing). <br/> <br/>
			
			There are also several special courses, including IS 399, IS 478, IS 479, IS 469, IS 397, and IS 467, among others, that cannot be used
			to satisfy the  <br/>
			IS upper-level elective requirement, but that students can use to gain academic credit for internships, coops, and research projects. See your advisor for <br/>
			more information.
